TODO:

Put a cap on spawn rate
BUG:
  attack power of units is universal, instead of when it gets created
  solution:
    use a variable to make an instance of the unit
    average that variable together based on unitcount when they merge


IMPROVEMENT:
Color code the difficulty of the next level based on # units spawning * total unit growth
  
HELPFUL:
Tooltips:
  Spells - Get 10 max mana on level up, more mana gain, and cheaper spells.
  Fireball - Deals 5 damage per stacked enemy, then 17 damage!
  Chain Lightning - Does 18 damage to 3 units!

IMPROVEMENT:
Graphics on the bullet
slow down the bullet

IMPROVEMENT:
reset button at the top of battle

IMPROVEMENT:
change the spawn upgrade rate from 5% reduction to +5% slower
	make it cheaper to buy

MAJOR IMPROVEMENT:
add a new unit type

IMPROVEMENT:
Spell level gives talent points
Each spell has 2 options - Damage and Utility
Utility increases cost and damage too and 2 talent points
lower spell level gain cost
FireBall - damage upgrades by 9 per talent point
	utility: dmg + 3, base mana cost + 2, dmg per unit + 1
chain lightning - dmg upgrades by 9 per talent point
	utility: cost 2, extra arc, base mana cost *= previous mana - current mana * .9
	
IMPROVEMENT:
round fex stacks to ints when upgrading

IMPROVEMENT:
Numbering the unit spawners
	
ANALYSIS:
The spawner might lag when it has high amounts. check the math

NECESSARY:
Goals, like unlocking units
	
	
As of December, 2015 this part is outdated. I wrote it at
the start and didn't change it
